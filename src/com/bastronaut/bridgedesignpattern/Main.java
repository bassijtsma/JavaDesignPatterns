/*
Looks similar to adapter pattern. However, the bridge pattern
is planned in advance, rather than done to deal with legacy
code. It's meant to decouple abstraction and implementation,
using encapsulation, composition and inheritance. It is designed
so that changes in abstraction will not affect the client.
This can be done when you know the details won't be right
from the start.
