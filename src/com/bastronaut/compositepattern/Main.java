/*
Meant to treat components the same whether it is part of a structure,
or the whole structure itself. Done by configuring object into a tree
structure. Once done, you can treat individual objects as composite object.

advantage: apply operations to individual and composite objects the same
way. Example: RESTful services GET operations are almost always implemented
with the composite model
